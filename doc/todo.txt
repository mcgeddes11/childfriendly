- Fine tune the methodology for each dimension, especially the census data
- Write a new task to download, extract and pickle the traffic data for BC
- Extend BuildDatabase to export the traffic data
- Implement traffic data scoring in the scoring service
- Include sex of child as an input parameter to refine demographic scoring
- Include province code (e.g. BC, AB) in all relevant tables
- Break down schools by elementary/secondary based on age of child (ie. 1-6 -> elementary; 7-9 -> both; 10-18 ->
- Figure out where to put the services so they can be accessed by the app and the data processing pipeline


FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
- look at school zonings do better refine scoring
- include cultural mix as a dimension
- make dimensions configurable (e.g. schools are very important, demographics less so)
