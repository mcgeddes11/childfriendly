TODO IN TRELLO:
- Fine tune the methodology for each dimension, especially the census data - (DONE, MOSTLY)
- Write new task(s) to extract and pickle the traffic data for BC, AB, ON
- Include AB, ON as supported provinces by providing schools and traffic data
- Extend BuildDatabase to export the traffic data
- Implement traffic data scoring in the scoring service - this will be more involved
- Include sex of child as an input parameter to refine demographic scoring
- Include province code (e.g. BC, AB) in all relevant tables
- Filter by province in the scoring service when creating baselines for census data
- Break down schools by elementary/secondary based on age of child (ie. 1-6 -> elementary; 7-9 -> both; 10-18 -> secondary)
- Figure out where to put the services so they can be accessed by the app and the data processing pipeline (DONE)
- Implement/test sign in functionality
- Implement email/contact functionality
- Implement Facebook sharing functionality
- Implement Twitter sharing functionality
- Remove Instagram sharing button
- Create 'About' page

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
- look at school zonings to better refine scoring
- include cultural mix as a dimension
- make dimensions configurable (e.g. schools are very important, demographics less so)
-
